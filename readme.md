This is a bot used in the room of the same name on Turntable.fm. Uses the 
[TurnTable API](https://github.com/alaingilbert/Turntable-API) and is inspired by 
[Sparkle Turntable Bot](https://github.com/sharedferret/Sparkle-Turntable-Bot), 
[hashtag-amy](https://github.com/yayramen/hashtag-amy) and other bots around the net. 
Special thanks to the guys in [turntable room]() for the playcount sample code.
